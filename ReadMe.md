## Inspiration

Thinking about all the people who entered this valentines day lonely (including me) inspired me to create this app. Since most people would watch movies in such a case, I thought about creating a movie recommendation app in the style of Tinder.

## What it does

Swipe left, right, or even upwards/downwards to a selection of movies - in true Tinder fashion. Then, based on your tastes, the app will recommend you a movie to watch this Valentine's day. Don't worry, it is not necessary to be with somebody special to watch these movies :)

## How we built it

I built it using the Java and Android Studio.

## Challenges we ran into

Creating a Tinder-like swap mechanic was very challenging since I am a beginner to Android Studio. That took a lot of time for me to learn. Also, time management was a very big issue. I spent so much time on the swapping mechanic that I barely had the time to add the final "Recommendations" page. This is the reason why that part is a little underwhelming in the project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I am proud with how the app looks. The Tinder-esque esthetic really works for this app. I am also proud that this app idea can be developed further in the future.

## What we learned

Time management skills and Swipe-able Views in Android Studio.

## What's next for Filmder

A UI update is very much needed, especially for the final part. Also, an update to the recommendation algorithm would really benefit the app.
